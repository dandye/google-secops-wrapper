# Development Guide

This guide provides information for developers working on the Google SecOps SDK for Python.

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/google/secops-wrapper.git
   cd secops-wrapper
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

## Testing

### Running Tests

We use pytest for testing. To run the tests:

```bash
pytest
```

To run tests with coverage:

```bash
pytest --cov=secops
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Name test files with the prefix `test_`
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested

## Code Style

We follow the Google Python Style Guide. To check your code style:

```bash
# Run linting
flake8 src/ tests/

# Run type checking
mypy src/
```

## Documentation

### Building Documentation

To build the documentation locally:

```bash
cd docs
pip install -r requirements.txt
make html
```

The built documentation will be available in `docs/_build/html/`.

To serve the documentation locally:

```bash
cd docs
make serve
```

Then open your browser to http://localhost:8000.

### Writing Documentation

- Use Markdown for documentation files
- Follow the existing documentation structure
- Include examples where appropriate
- Document all public APIs with docstrings

## Release Process

1. Update version in `pyproject.toml`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the new version and changes
3. Create a new Git tag for the version
4. Build the distribution packages:
   ```bash
   python -m build
   ```
5. Upload to PyPI:
   ```bash
   python -m twine upload dist/*
   ```

## Continuous Integration

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The CI pipeline runs:

- Linting
- Type checking
- Tests on multiple Python versions
- Documentation building

All pull requests must pass CI checks before they can be merged.
